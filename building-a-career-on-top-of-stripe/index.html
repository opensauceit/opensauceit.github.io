<p>How investing time learning Stripe’s API helped me earn thousands of dollars and how you or anyone can do it too!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Let’s-talk-online-money-first"><a href="#Let’s-talk-online-money-first" class="headerlink" title="Let’s talk online money first"></a>Let’s talk online money first</h2><p>If there’s one truth and commonality about most companies on the internet: They like to make money. Yet, only <strong>3%</strong> of all global transactions are conducted online.</p>
<p>Worry not, that’s still a lot of money being moved every single day around the interwebs.</p>
<p>What most people don’t know is to move money on the internet you <em>NEED</em> to be able to process payments:</p>
<ul>
<li>quickly</li>
<li>securely</li>
<li>effectively </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="A-HA-moment"><a href="#A-HA-moment" class="headerlink" title="A-HA moment"></a>A-HA moment</h2><p>Suddenly business owners realize they need a payment processor. If you can deliver it to them, you found a way to invoice them 🤑</p>
<p>This below is a story based on my personal and professional experience.</p>
<h4 id="Processing-payments-requires-a-couple-things"><a href="#Processing-payments-requires-a-couple-things" class="headerlink" title="Processing payments requires a couple things:"></a>Processing payments requires a couple things:</h4><ul>
<li>A payment processing platform</li>
<li>An entity paying money</li>
<li>An entity receiving money</li>
</ul>
<p>and obviously…</p>
<ul>
<li>A fee to pay the processing platform for all their hard work</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the hardest part to sell to a customer who desperately needs of a reliable way to accept payments.<br>Percentages, fees, extra charges…there’s a lot going on. It is not an easy conversation to have with a business owner that just wants to maximize profits.</p>
<h4 id="Think-of-it-this-way…"><a href="#Think-of-it-this-way…" class="headerlink" title="Think of it this way…"></a>Think of it this way…</h4><p>When you send a letter with snail-mail you leverage the same 3 things. You need to have at least:</p>
<ul>
<li>a stamp (your processing fee)</li>
<li>the letter (the money)</li>
<li>the information that goes in the FROM and TO fields (entities paying/receiving)</li>
<li>a working mail network. (the platform)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Reliable-payment-processing"><a href="#Reliable-payment-processing" class="headerlink" title="Reliable payment processing"></a>Reliable payment processing</h3><p>Unreliable processing of transaction is a disgrace. Sometimes the user interfaces are unclear. Other times the process takes too long and errors are being thrown on to the user’s face. That makes for a crap user experience.</p>
<aside>Many times I have experienced <em>ACME company</em> not providing a reliable payment experience.</aside>

<p>If you type in google <code>online payment processing</code>…the first <em>organic</em> result is <strong>Stripe</strong>.</p>
<p>Stripe acts as the platform who manages the <strong>mail network</strong> in the example explained earlier: it allows me to send and receive money. I can pay for services and goods, pay other people… in a very secure and transparent manner. At a very low cost.</p>
<p>Similiarly to handling mail across nations in the mail network, payment processing is <strong>very hard</strong> to do right. You need professionals to do it.</p>
<p>There are <strong>hidden and visible layers of complexity</strong> on <strong>every</strong> level of the payment flow.<br>Imagine having to implement multiple payments methods such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>ACH Debit</li>
<li>SOFORT</li>
<li>Bancontact</li>
<li>Giropay</li>
<li>iDEAL</li>
<li>AMEX<br>into your own stack.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Complexity-can-be-a-good-thing"><a href="#Complexity-can-be-a-good-thing" class="headerlink" title="Complexity can be a good thing."></a>Complexity can be a good thing.</h3><p>Complex systems can be good when well thought out. They prove that there are a lot of intricacies that are being handled by the various components of the complex system.</p>
<h3 id="Stripe-removes-the-complexity"><a href="#Stripe-removes-the-complexity" class="headerlink" title="Stripe removes the complexity"></a>Stripe removes the complexity</h3><p>Stripe takes away the complexity by providing developers with excellent tools to build payment systems.</p>
<p>When using a tool like Stripe, you know they follow all the best practices to make sure you’re safe when executing online transactions.</p>
<p><strong>No matter at which end of the transaction you’re at.</strong></p>
<h2 id="One-API-many-opportunities"><a href="#One-API-many-opportunities" class="headerlink" title="One API, many opportunities"></a>One API, many opportunities</h2><h3 id="Me-APIs-and-Stripe"><a href="#Me-APIs-and-Stripe" class="headerlink" title="Me, APIs and Stripe"></a>Me, APIs and Stripe</h3><p>Stripe,  Twilio, SendGrid and other companies launched around 2010, took building API <strong>super seriously</strong>. APIs will eat the world they thought; they were right!</p>
<p>Before Stripe I believed only PayPal, Worldpay and Adyen were the players in the world of online payments. I was so oblivious.</p>
<h3 id="Discovering-Stripe"><a href="#Discovering-Stripe" class="headerlink" title="Discovering Stripe"></a>Discovering Stripe</h3><p>Unlike most API companies, specifically payment ones, using Stripe is like travelling in Premier/First class on a 17 hours flight.</p>
<p>Most companies don’t spend nearly enough time documenting and providing developers a great experience, like they do.</p>
<p>Stripe does things the way developers love it:</p>
<ul>
<li>The documentation is so incredibly accurate and thought-out. It has helped Stripe build a core audience of fanatic customers.</li>
<li>The visual aspect of every thing built by Stripe is flawless. It makes you feel empowered, curious and safe (you know what to expect on every click)</li>
<li>It’s always easy to find whatever documentation you’re looking for.</li>
<li>They provide wrappers/libraries, technical support and a lot of perks to partners.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Doing-things-the-Stripe-way-helps-you-succeed"><a href="#Doing-things-the-Stripe-way-helps-you-succeed" class="headerlink" title="Doing things the Stripe way helps you succeed"></a>Doing things the Stripe way helps you succeed</h3><p>Striving to be as good as Stripe is where many companies want to be.</p>
<p>They’ve shown it. Investing time doing things in an appealing way for your userbase (developers) is a GREAT way to scale and succeed in your vertical.</p>
<p>Stripe is currently valued ca. $35B. The chances of building a business as successful as Stripe are very small. Yet can still aim to be as good as Stripe, in terms of developer experience.</p>
<p>Here’s why I personally use and recommend Stripe:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have been using Stripe on multiple projects (software and hardware), different clients, different tech-stacks. I have never felt like I was lost. I can’t say it’s been as smooth as this, for other payment processing companies</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Conclusions-What’s-Stripe-to-me"><a href="#Conclusions-What’s-Stripe-to-me" class="headerlink" title="Conclusions: What’s Stripe to me"></a>Conclusions: What’s Stripe to me</h2><p>To name a few things that define Stripe in my mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Focused</li>
<li>Professional</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="The-Morale-of-the-story"><a href="#The-Morale-of-the-story" class="headerlink" title="The Morale of the story"></a>The Morale of the story</h3><blockquote>
<p>Picking a company’s API to build a pipeline of projects and clients can be a very profitable way to ensure a consistent flow of cash into your reserves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Learning to use Stripe has brought me to discuss payment processing with a lot of different people. Using their API platform is a great experience and therefore implementing Stripe for multiple users and scenario has <strong>never felt like a burden</strong>.<br>One of my most recent projects uses Stripe Terminals and another one uses Stripe to handle Millions of $ of transactions from a marketplace. </p>
<p>I have learned a great deal through Stripe and I have to thank them for multiple engagements, project and work that I have been able to secure. Basically 💵 in my pocket.</p>
<h3 id="The-Obvious-Conclusion"><a href="#The-Obvious-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="The Obvious Conclusion"></a>The Obvious Conclusion</h3><p>As a developer and as someone building developer tools you must spend time on documentation, making sure it’s actually helpful. Building a great system isn’t sufficient if no one else can use it.</p>
<p>The Stripe products are super-focused. I can’t remember of a single product they’ve launched that wasn’t exceptional in what it did.</p>
<p>Stripe has always been focused on releasing exceptionally well built software for professionals. Yet simple for their users to use. Both developers and customers.</p>
<p>To name a few things, everything like dashboards, documentation, websites, APIs… is created with an incredible attention to details.</p>
<p>They manage to deliver WOW after WOW after WOW moments, year after year.</p>
