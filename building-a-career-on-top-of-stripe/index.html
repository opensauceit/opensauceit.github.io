    <blockquote>
<p>How investing time learning Stripe’s API helped me earn thousands of dollars and how you or anyone can do it too!</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Let’s-talk-online-money-first"><a href="#Let’s-talk-online-money-first" class="headerlink" title="Let’s talk online money first"></a>Let’s talk online money first</h2><p>If there’s one truth and commonality about most companies on the internet, it’s that they like to make money. Yet, only 3% of all global transactions are conducted online.</p>
<p>Worry not, that’s still a lot of money being moved every single day around the interwebs.</p>
<p>What most people don’t know is to move money on the internet you NEED to be able to process payments:</p>
<ul>
<li>quickly</li>
<li>securely</li>
<li>effectively</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="The-A-HA-moment"><a href="#The-A-HA-moment" class="headerlink" title="The A-HA moment"></a>The A-HA moment</h2><p>Suddenly business owners realize they need a payment processor. If you can deliver it to them, you found a way to invoice them. 🤑</p>
<p>The below is a story based on my personal and professional experience.</p>
<h4 id="Processing-payments-requires-a-few-things"><a href="#Processing-payments-requires-a-few-things" class="headerlink" title="Processing payments requires a few things:"></a>Processing payments requires a few things:</h4><ul>
<li>A payment processing platform</li>
<li>An entity paying money</li>
<li>An entity receiving money</li>
</ul>
<p>and obviously…</p>
<ul>
<li>a fee to pay the processing platform for all their hard work.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the hardest part to sell to a customer who desperately needs a reliable way to accept payments. Percentages, fees, extra charges…there’s a lot going on. It’s not an easy conversation to have with a business owner who just wants to maximize their profits.</p>
<h4 id="Think-of-it-this-way…"><a href="#Think-of-it-this-way…" class="headerlink" title="Think of it this way…"></a>Think of it this way…</h4><p>When you send a letter via snail-mail you leverage the same 3 things. You need to have at least:</p>
<ul>
<li>a stamp (your processing fee)</li>
<li>the letter (the money)</li>
<li>the information that goes in the FROM and TO fields (entities paying/receiving)</li>
<li>a working mail network. (the platform)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Reliable-payment-processing"><a href="#Reliable-payment-processing" class="headerlink" title="Reliable payment processing"></a>Reliable payment processing</h3><p>Unreliable transaction processing is a disgrace. Sometimes the user interfaces are unclear. Other times the process takes too long and errors are thrown into the user’s face. That makes for a poor user experience.</p>
<aside>Multiple times, I have experienced companies not providing a reliable payment experience.</aside>

<p>If you Google “online payment processing”… the first <em>organic</em> result is <strong>Stripe</strong>.</p>
<p>Stripe acts as the platform which manages the mail network in the example explained earlier: it allows me to send and receive money. I can pay for services and goods, pay other people… in a very secure and transparent manner. At a very low cost.</p>
<p>Similarly to transporting mail across locations in a network, payment processing is very hard to get right. You need professionals to do it.</p>
<p>There are <strong>hidden and visible layers of complexity</strong> on <strong>every</strong> level of the payment flow.<br>Imagine having to implement multiple payment methods such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>ACH Debit</li>
<li>SOFORT</li>
<li>Bancontact</li>
<li>Giropay</li>
<li>iDEAL</li>
<li>AMEX</li>
</ul>
<p>into your own stack!</p>
<h3 id="Complexity-can-be-a-good-thing"><a href="#Complexity-can-be-a-good-thing" class="headerlink" title="Complexity can be a good thing."></a>Complexity can be a good thing.</h3><p>Complex systems can be good when they are well thought out. They prove there are a lot of intricacies being handled by the various components of the complex system.</p>
<p><strong>Stripe removes the complexity by providing developers with excellent tools to build payment systems.</strong></p>
<p>When using a tool like Stripe, you know they follow all the best practices to make sure you’re safe when executing online transactions.</p>
<p><strong>No matter at which end of the transaction you’re at.</strong></p>
<h2 id="One-API-many-opportunities"><a href="#One-API-many-opportunities" class="headerlink" title="One API, many opportunities"></a>One API, many opportunities</h2><h3 id="APIs-Stripe-and-I"><a href="#APIs-Stripe-and-I" class="headerlink" title="APIs, Stripe and I"></a>APIs, Stripe and I</h3><p>Stripe, Twilio, SendGrid and other similar companies launched around 2010, and all took building APIs very seriously. APIs will eat the world they thought - they were right!</p>
<p>Before Stripe I believed only PayPal, Worldpay and Adyen were the players in the world of online payments. I was so oblivious!</p>
<h3 id="Discovering-Stripe"><a href="#Discovering-Stripe" class="headerlink" title="Discovering Stripe"></a>Discovering Stripe</h3><p>Unlike most API companies, specifically payment ones (remember early Braintree?), using Stripe is like travelling in business class on a 17 hour flight.</p>
<p>Most companies don’t spend nearly enough time documenting and providing developers a great experience, like they do.</p>
<p>Stripe does things the way developers love it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their documentation is incredibly accurate and thought-out - this alone helped Stripe build a core audience of fanatic customers</li>
<li>The visual aspect of everything built by Stripe is flawless - iIt makes you feel empowered, curious and secure, as you know what to expect with every click</li>
<li>They make it easy to find whatever documentation you’re looking for</li>
<li>They provide wrappers/libraries, technical support and a lot of perks to partners</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Doing-things-the-Stripe-way-helps-you-succeed"><a href="#Doing-things-the-Stripe-way-helps-you-succeed" class="headerlink" title="Doing things the Stripe way helps you succeed"></a>Doing things the Stripe way helps you succeed</h3><p>Striving to be as good as Stripe is where many companies want to be.</p>
<p>The way Stripe has done is by showing that investing time in crafting an experience that’s appealing to your core users - developers - will help you scale all your efforts, backed my the support and enthusiasm of your users/customers.</p>
<p>Stripe is currently valued at around $35B. The chance of building a business as successful as Stripe is very small. Yet, you can still aim to be as good as Stripe, in terms of developer experience.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s why I personally recommend Stripe:</strong> I’ve used it for multiple projects (software and hardware through Terminals), different clients, different tech-stacks. I have never felt like I was lost. I’ve never had such a smooth experience with any other payment processing companies. I will always recommend Stripe to any project I am involved which requires it.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusions-what-Stripe-is-to-me"><a href="#Conclusions-what-Stripe-is-to-me" class="headerlink" title="Conclusions: what Stripe is to me"></a>Conclusions: what Stripe is to me</h2><p>Here’s how I define Stripe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Focused</li>
<li>Professional</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="The-Morale-of-the-story"><a href="#The-Morale-of-the-story" class="headerlink" title="The Morale of the story"></a>The Morale of the story</h3><blockquote>
<p>Choosing a company’s API to build a pipeline of projects and clients can be a very profitable way to ensure a consistent flow of cash into your reserves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Learning to use Stripe has enabled me to discuss payment processing with a lot of different people. Using their API platform is a great experience, and therefore, implementing Stripe for multiple users and scenarios has never felt like a burden.</p>
<p>One of my most recent projects uses Stripe Terminals and another one uses Stripe to handle millions of USD transactions from a marketplace.</p>
<p>I have learned a great deal through Stripe and I have to thank them for multiple projects that I’ve been able to secure. Basically 💵 in my pocket.</p>
<h3 id="In-conclusion"><a href="#In-conclusion" class="headerlink" title="In conclusion"></a>In conclusion</h3><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ARMtoGr.png" alt="Meeting John at the first Stripe Meetup in London - June 23rd 2015"><br>As a developer and as someone building developer tools you must spend time on documentation, to make sure it’s actually helpful. Building a great system isn’t sufficient if no one else can use it.</p>
<p>Stripe products are laser focused, and they have always released exceptionally well built software for professionals, that are simple to use - for both developers and customers.</p>
<p>To name just a few things, from dashboards, documentation, websites, and APIs…all are created with an incredible attention to detail.</p>
<p>They manage to deliver WOW after WOW after WOW moments, year after year!</p>
